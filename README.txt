HOW TO START?
To start the programme, please run app.py.
The programme also uses spoonacularapi.py and assets/typography.css.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
The user can choose to build a meal plan or solely display most relevant recipes.
The user is required to input spare or newly purchased ingredients into the input box and click the submit button.
The user can also specify dietary preferences and filter the cuisines by ticking the relevant boxes above the input field.

PLEASE NOTE: As much as we tried to optimise the speed of the search, the API response can be slow at times. As a result, it may take a while for the results to display on the screen.
